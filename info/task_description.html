    I've started to feed one of the pigeons.
    A minute later two more flew down and a minute after that another 3.
    Then 4, and so on (Ex: 1+2+3+4+...). A pigeon eats one portion of food in a minute,
    but in case there's not enough food for all the birds, the pigeons whoâ€™ve arrived first eat first.
    Pigeons are hungry animals and eat without knowing when to stop.
    If I have <strong>N</strong> portions of bird food, how many pigeons will be fed with at least one portion of wheat?

    This task illustrates how we can model various situations.
    Of course, the model has a limited approximation, but often-times we don't need a perfect model.
